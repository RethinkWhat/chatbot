FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library developed by Facebook AI Research. It is used for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. FAISS is widely used in information retrieval systems, recommendation engines, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines. It supports fast indexing and querying of large-scale vector data, making it suitable for real-time applications in AI.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence focused on the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves techniques for processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data. Common NLP tasks include tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and question answering.

RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an approach that combines a retrieval mechanism with a generative language model. In this architecture, the retriever searches a knowledge base for relevant documents based on a user query, and then the generator formulates a response using both the query and retrieved documents. This allows for more factual and grounded answers, especially when the language model does not have the needed knowledge in its training data.

Example of NLP in action:
A customer support chatbot uses NLP to understand and respond to user queries. When a user asks, "What is your return policy?", the system extracts keywords, determines the intent, retrieves relevant knowledge base content, and generates a natural-sounding response.

Another example:
Using FAISS, a recommendation system indexes product descriptions and searches for similar products based on customer queries or embeddings generated from user preferences.
